<h1>Enphase IQ Gateway Client</h1>
<p>This site provides the ability to talk to the Enphase IQ Gateway.</p>

<p>Enphase IQ Gateway is a box that solar panel systems use to monitor the generation and consumption of power.</p>
<p>You can submit requests to the IQ Gateway and receive JSON responses in a browser. For that you'll need an
  authorization token. That is explained <a
    href="https://enphase.com/download/accessing-iq-gateway-local-apis-or-local-ui-token-based-authentication"
    target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>What this web client does is allow you to make the same requests, and it displays the responses in a more readable,
  formatted way.</p>
<p>You'll still need to <a
    href="https://enphase.com/download/accessing-iq-gateway-local-apis-or-local-ui-token-based-authentication"
    target="_blank">obtain an auth token</a>, and set it in the appsettings.json configuration file at the root of this
  site.</p>

    <p>You can get pretty much this same data online at <a
    href="https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/"
    target="_blank">enlighten.enphaseenergy.com</a>. The reason I wrote this is that often I find that the online service is showing me data from hours behind.</p>
    <p>Still to come in future versions: Store the responses in a database, and a data collector that periodically
      submits requests and stores the responses. Also some views in this site that show historical data.</p>
